### Talk

This talk explores the need to enable visibility into failures that occur during lab testing and field testing when you build apps for hardware. Consider the extra dimension of experiencing an issue when a field test user is in the middle of garden with no internet connectivity and just their phone and the hardware device. The app takes on the responsiblity of shedding light onto the problem.
