## iOSCon & Skills Matter

iOSCon 2019 is the go-to conference to discover and learn all the latest developments in the iOS and Swift world.

### Talk

Apple’s iOS development platform was released over 10 years ago. Since then, significant changes have been made to the toolset and languages surrounding iOS app development. When a development platform reaches this age it is increasingly frequent that:
* iOS engineers will encounter ‘legacy’ iOS apps (apps where the majority of architecture was built with outdated language, APIs and toolset references).
* When encountering such apps, the challenges of working within the constraints imposed will be greater.
* There will be a need to evaluate the value of continuing development of such a legacy app versus alternatives such as a rewrite.
